# Gameplay Conventions

## Sunset
Sunset is not a discrete point in time, but is spread over three periods of twilight between day and night. The point at which a vampire wakes from day-sleep is dependent on the vampire's blood potency:
* A vampire with Blood Potency 1 wakes upon the onset of civil twilight.
* A vampire with Blood Potency 2 wakes upon the onset of nautical twilight.
* A vampire with Blood Potency 3 wakes upon the onset of astronomical twilight.
* A vampire with Blood Potency 4 or higher wakes only upon the onset of true night.
