# Anarchy Rising
It is a time of adventure. Heroes and villains alike seek their fortunes across the galaxy. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Mos Eisley spaceport, a wretched hive of scum and villainy situated on the desert planet of Tatooine.

The Hutts command a strong presence in Mos Eisley, but they are not the only criminals. Rival syndicates and cabals prowl the dusty streets, making profits at the expense of one another and society at large. Inevitably these disparate groups collide, their conflicting interests leading to open strife.

As unrest grips Mos Eisley's underworld, Prello the Hutt contacts a group of mysterious heroes, requesting their aid in locating one of her valued retainers. Can they find him before his enemies do?
