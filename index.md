Welcome to the official website for Stormchaser Roleplaying!

I'm Kyle, also known as 'Stormchaser', and I'm a veteran Games Master and writer with almost 20 years of experience. I create homebrew and run play-by-post campaigns for pen-and-paper roleplaying games. This includes, but is not limited to, *Dungeons and Dragons* (including a variety of other d20 systems such as *Star Wars Saga Edition* and *Pathfinder*), *World of Darkness*, *GURPS*, *Call of Cthulhu*, *WFRP*, *Apocalypse World*, *Blades in the Dark* and many more.

Roughly half of my campaigns are set in my own custom, self-written fantasy setting of *Arden*, a world steeped in intricate mysteries and deep lore.  These games are also run using my own systems; the [Stormchaser Roleplaying Game](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/stormchaserRPG/) and [Heroes in the Storm](https://stormchaserroleplaying.com/heroesinthestorm/), a Forged in the Dark RPG for high-fantasy adventures.

More information on Stormchaser Roleplaying projects, house rules and campaigns can be found in the side bar, as well as in the list of links below.
