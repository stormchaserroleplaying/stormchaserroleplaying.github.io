# The Reprievers
**Roric**, the ward boss who ran the criminal operations in Crow’s Foot, has been killed. People say that it was his second-in-command, **Lyssa**, who did it. She now controls Roric’s impressive gang of cutthroats, who call themselves the Crows.

When Roric died, the peace that he had brokered between two enemy gangs fell apart. **The Lampblacks** and **the Red Sashes** have once again exploded into open war on the streets.

**A local crew of hawkers** is poised to profit from all of this, or be swept up in the chaos and destroyed.
